## Object Detection System with OpenCV and Matplotlib
This repository contains a basic Object Detection system that uses OpenCV for image/video processing and Matplotlib for visualization. The system is capable of detecting objects in images or video streams using pre-trained models and visualizing the results with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features
Object Detection: Detects and visualizes objects in images or videos using pre-trained models.

Bounding Boxes: Visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

Matplotlib Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to display images and videos with detected objects.

OpenCV Processing: OpenCV is used for reading, processing, and displaying images and videos.

## Installation
## Prerequisites
Python 3.12.4

opencv-python for image/video processing

matplotlib for visualization
